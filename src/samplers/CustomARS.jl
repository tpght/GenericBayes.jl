The author of AdaptiveRejectionSampling.jl does not allow an option to pass the
log-density directly, only the density itself. Therefore, I hadto copy his code
so that we can work with the log-density.

A log conconcave function is majorized with a piecewise envelop, which on the original scale is piecewise
exponential. As the resulting extremely precise envelop adapts, the rejection rate dramatically decreases.
